# Node.js Sandbox Learning

## So in this project, I learned:

1. About the Node.js runtime environment
2. Basics of the Node Package Manager (NPM)
3. Learned fundamentals to server side scripting and hyper text transfer protocols (HTTP)
4. Learned how to deploy web prototypes to Heroku - (love how seemless it is with Git)

## My biggest take aways
Involving PHP pages, is avoidable. Its really nice to have a server side language thats based in JavaScript. 

JS is king and I will continue to use frameworks/libraries such as Express, React, to go along with my new Node.js skills. 

Great for fast/secure prototyping.


## Future Learnings
1. Continue to develop and deploy using Node.js
2. Express.js framework
3. React.js library
